# LoSTanSiBLE

*Low Speed Trading and Small in Budget; Large Expenses*

This is an programming and machine learning, in particular deep learning, exercise. The stage of this execises is stock market trading.

## Motivation and Objective

> ansible - a fictional device for instantaneous communication. [Source](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ansible&utm_source=search-action)

Basically, I want to indicate with the project's name a specific type stock market trading, where a trader does not have access to an ansible, i.e. is not capable of high speed algorithmic trading. Primary target group are traders, in particular individuals, who

* have limited timeressources prohobiting them to look for their stocks
* only want to put a small amount of money at risk, and
* due to the bullet point above, experience high fees when trading. We consider the fees as high if the minimum transaction fee makes up between 5% to 10% of the amount of invested capital for a stock. 

For this group of traders, LoSTanSiBLE aims to provide some algorithmic support. The objective is to make them successful at the stock market.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
